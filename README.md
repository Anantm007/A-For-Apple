## Project Summary

A voice based educational web app - "A for üçé", to tackle the issue of illiteracy, especially in India. The app targets illiterates through NGOs across the country helping them learn how to read and write by including speech recognition Azure service.

The students will practice in groups according to their age and the web app will interact with them to display & validate their auditory response hence guiding them towards learning the course. Starting from as basic as ABC,123,‡§ï‡§ñ‡§ó,etc., the app aims to help them understand the meaning, pronunciation, spelling and construction of words in different languages. Exercises for basic mathematics have also been added with gamification.

With the help of NGOs and volunteering services along with a beautiful easy-2-use interactive UI, this app ensures eradication of illiteracy from the deepest root level of the nation taking learning to a whole new, innovative and exciting level.

## Need of the Project

India, being the home to the largest population of illiterate adults in the world, contributes to an illiteracy level of 25.96%. Low GDP, poverty, para-teachers and uninteractive and dull teaching methodologies are the major reasons of this high illiteracy rate. "A for üçé", is a truly voice based educating solution which targets illiterates through NGOs across the country helping them learn how to read, write and pronounce different languages.

The students interact in groups with the web app and the application displays & validates their auditory response, hence guiding them towards learning the course. Basic courses of ABC,123,‡§ï‡§ñ‡§ó,etc have been added along with basic mathematics with gamification.

NGOs can interact with volunteers and organize events and socialize to spread awareness. Graphical analysis provides us with their usage data thus helping us target NGOs with minimal or no activity. Using maps, volunteers can access nearby NGO locations. Areas with no NGOs in close proximity or huge BPL population will be marked sperately on maps to grab attention to and help establish more such institutions and further help students to grow and learn. An open chatbox has been provided for volunteers and NGOs to stay in close connection to help achieve this endeavour.
